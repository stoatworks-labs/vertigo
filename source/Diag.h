/**
    Logging for a plugin that lives inside somebody else's process.

    A small member of the fleet's `diag` family. The rest of the repos get a
    rotating log, a crash report and a diagnostics bundle; an FFGL effect gets
    only the log, for two reasons:

    - **No crash handler.** A plugin loaded into Resolume must not install a
      process-wide signal handler. It would intercept faults that are not ours
      and interfere with the host's own handling. A plugin has no business
      deciding what happens when Resolume dies.
    - **No bundle command.** There is no UI to hang one off -- an effect is a
      list of sliders in someone else's inspector.

    What it covers is the failure that actually happens: `InitGL` returning
    `FF_FAIL` because the shader would not compile. From the operator's side
    that looks like "the effect does nothing", with no message anywhere. The GL
    vendor and version strings are logged next to it, because with one shader
    stage the driver is nearly always the rest of the answer.
